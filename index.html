        <h2>welcome to the wellesley mock trial website!</h2>
      	<p>The Wellesley College Mock Trial team was founded in 2000 to provide students with the opportunity to learn about the work of trial attorneys, better understand the judicial system, develop critical thinking skills, and enhance communication and public speaking ability through participation in mock trials sponsored by the American Mock Trial Association (AMTA).</p>        
        <p>Each August, AMTA releases a new, fictional case (alternating yearly between criminal and civil matters), containing a summary of the incident in question, affidavits of witnesses explaining different facets of the case, exhibits to support the witness affidavits, and relevant case law. The team begins work on the case in September, developing a case theory for both the prosecution / plaintiff and defense side sof the case. The team competes against other colleges at several tournaments over the course of the year, where students play the roles of attorneys and witnesses in the format of a real trial.</p> 
        <p>Though it is similar to acting, a good team is distinguished by their ability to think and respond quickly on its feet as things occur during trials. The mark of a good team is their ability to respond to the trial at hand and alter their case theory to win over the judges and win the trial.</p>
        <p>During trial, actual attorneys and judges will watch the round and score witnesses for their ability to portray their characters effectively and attorneys for their ability to respond to objections, rulings and the answers of both their own witnesses and those of other teams. During Regionals, these scores determine qualify teams to compete either at the National Tournament or the National Championship Tournament.</p>
